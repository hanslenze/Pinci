# Pinci

This is firmware for the little low-profile keyboard Pinci found on https://github.com/camrbuss/pinci. This key layout is based on [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) which I use on my "big" keyboard. My flavour of choice includes a Qwerty layout, inverted-T navigation and swapped space/backspace.
